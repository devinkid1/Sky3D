# Sky3D
Roblox module for creating custom 3D skies.

Highly inspired by [Skybox3D](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/a-free-dynamic-3d-skybox-module/789302), I have gotten confirmation to upload mine though. Check his out too!

If someone can, please help me with uploading source code to the repo. I know how to do releases but not source code ;-; (I just want to get PRs working with the code)

Warning: skies are as limited in rendering as ViewportFrames, so stuff like lights and shadows will not appear.
